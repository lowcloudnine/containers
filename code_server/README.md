# VS Code in Docker

[linuxserver.io](https://linuxserver.io) has a LOT of very interesting containers/images for Docker.
One of these is linuxserver/code-server and the files in the project are for starting it via both
Docker and docker-compose.

Please see:  [https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-code-server](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-code-server)
